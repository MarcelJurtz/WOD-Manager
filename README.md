# WOD-Manager

FullStack-Companion for my (clientside only) [functional fitness app](https://github.com/MarcelJurtz/Workouts). This app supports filtering workouts based on available equipment and utilizes a list of workouts provided via json-file.

This app however is targeting the maintenance of the workouts themselves and also includes an image generator to create workout-pictures for instagram.

## Features

* Manage workouts
* Manage equipment and specify required equipment (eg. Barbells for workouts)
* Add tags for specific workouts to allow filtering later on (eg. Hero-Wods, Benchmarks or Personal Favorites)
* Add hashtags to be used for instagram text placeholders. Hashtags can be added to all three: wods, equipment and tags. Use the config-file to specify which sources should be used for text-generation and how many hashtags should be used.
